    <h2>1. What is database? explain with an example on why should we need a database</h2>
    <p>Database are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. Used to store and manage large amounts of
        structured and unstructured data.
        They can be used to support wide range of activities, including data storage, data analysis and data management.
    </p>
<h2>2. Write a short note on file based storage system. Explain the major challenges of file based system</h2>
<p>File based storage system is a traditional approch to storing and managing data, where data is stored in individual
    files on a computer's file system. each file contains a collection of records with each record representing an entity or object in the sysytem.
    
</p>
<h3>Major challenges</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Data redundancy</li>
    <li>Data Inconsistency</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Data isolation</li>
</ol>
<h2>3. What is DBMS? what was the need for DBMS?</h2>
<p>Database Management system are software systems used to store, retrieve and run queries on data. A DBMS serves
    as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, abd delete data in the database.
</p>
<h3>Need of DBMS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Creation of a database</li>
    <li>Retrieval of information from the database</li>
    <li>Updating the database</li>
    <li>Managing a database</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS.</h2>
<h3>1.Data redundancy</h3>
<p>Redudancy means repetition of same data in different tables. Redudancyleads to eccess data storage and may cause data inconsistency.</p>
<h3>2.Data inconsistency</h3>
<p>When same data is managed differntly in different places leads to data inconsistency. Data inconsistencycreates 
    unrealiable information, because it will be difficult to determine which version of information is correct.
</p>
<h3>3.Data isolation</h3>
<p>In file sysytem because data mapping is not supported, so all the files are created and kept in isolation. This is called data isolation.</p>
<h3>4.Controlled Data sharing</h3>
<p>It is very difficult to provide access control of data at different level for different user in a file system.</p>
<h3>5. Data dependence</h3>
<p>Data are stored in a specific format or structure in a file. If the structure or format is changed, all the existing application
    programs accessing that file also need to change.
</p>
<h2>5. List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.</h2>
<h3>Based on Data model</h3>
<p>The data model defines the physical and logical structure of a database which involves th datatypes, the relationship among the data,constraints applied on 
    the data and even the basic operations specifying retrieval and updation of data in the database.
</p>
<h3>Based on Number of Users</h3>
<p>The database management systems can also be classifid on the basis of its user. so, a DBMS can either b used by a single user or it can be used by multiple users.</p>
<h3>Based on Database Distribution</h3>
<p>Depending on the distribution of the database over numerous sites we can classify the database as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Centralized DBMS</li>
    <p>In the Centralized DBMS, the entire database is stored in a single computer site.</p>
    <li>Distributed DBMS</li>
    <p>In the Distributed DBMS the database and the DBMS software are distributed over many omputer sites.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Based on cost of Database</h2>
<p>The large systems along with the components that can handle distribution of database, replication of database, parallel processing,
    mobile capability and so on can be sold in the form of licenses.
</p>
<h2>Based on flow control</h2>
<p>Based upon the flow of control from application to DBMS the database management system is broadly classified into two types active database management systemand passive database management system.</p>
<h2>6. What is the significance of Data modelling and explain the types of Data modelling.</h2>
<p>Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to
    communicate connections between data points and structures. The goal is to illustrate the types of data used and stored within
    the system, the relationship among these datatypes, the ways the data can be grouped and organised and its formats and attributes.

</p>
<h3>Types of Data modeling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hierarchical data models</li>
    <li>Relational data models</li>
    <li>Entity-relationship data models</li>
    <li>Object-oriented data models</li>
    <li>Dimensional data models</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.</h2>
<p>The three-schema architecture is a design approch for databases that splits data views into three layers.</p>
<h3>Three schema architecture components:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>External schema(user view)</li>
    <p>This level represents the way individual users or user groups view the data.</p>
    <li>Conceptual schema(logcal view)</li>
    <p>This level represents the logical structure of the whole database as seen by the administrator.</p>
    <li>Internal schema(physical view)</li>
    <p>This level defines how and where the data is stored and accessed.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Advantages of three schema architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data independence</li>
    <li>Flexibility</li>
    <li>Efficient data access</li>
    <li>Improved security</li>
</ul>
